## must

- ensure automerge waits for all checks to pass
  - see note in https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#platformautomerge
    - also, from "By default, Renovate will not automerge until it sees passing status checks / check runs for the branch" i understand it may merge as soon as _some_ checks pass
  - consider platformAutomerge=false for the time being

## should

- update lock files less regularly
  - eg, once a week

## could

- don't update to versions as soon as they're released
  - eg, wait for a few days
  - see https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#minimumreleaseage
  - for security and stability reasons
    - eg, changes are a new version may require a follow-up version release to fix a bug
    - eg, to allow other users to consume the new version and report/fix issues before i update
- simplify pr title
  - "Update dependency"
- switch to dependabot
  - renovate doesn't seem very robust
    - why does it take hours to automerge?
    - some defaults make no sense to me (eg, rangeStrategy)
  - i stopped using dependabot in the past because they removed automerge support but it seems there's an alternative now
    - https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions#common-dependabot-automations
  - it uses github actions, which seem more customisable

## won't

- renovate to not rename a pr title
  - eg, by suffixing "autoclose" when it closes a pr
  - that breaks the email threads from notifications
  - how?
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prtitlestrict
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#commitmessageextra
  - it looks like some logic depends on the suffix "autoclose" to be present

- https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#github-merge-queue
  - mentioned in https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/#make-updating-easy-and-fast as a best practice but i'm not sure it's worth it in single-dev repos
- lock file maintenance prs to include details about the changes
  - eg, what packages were updated, their old and new versions, their changelog
  - probably can't be done as a renovate user
- https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#branch-vs-pr-automerging
  - not sure it's a good idea not getting any notification a repo was updated
- support having comments in the default.json
  - using json5 (ie, default.json5) should work
    - source: https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/
    - vscode support is bad though
      - not supported natively
      - marketplace alternatives don't support other json ide features (eg, schema autocomplete)
      - treating .json5 files as "JSON with Comments" doesn't do the trick as vscode prettier extension formats json5 files, making them invalid json with comments
