## must

- ensure automerge waits for all checks to pass
  - see note in https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#platformautomerge
    - also, from "By default, Renovate will not automerge until it sees passing status checks / check runs for the branch" i understand it may merge as soon as _some_ checks pass
  - consider platformAutomerge=false for the time being

## should

- how to add comments to default.json?

## could

- Renovate to only create PRs during off-hours (see https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#schedule)
- automerge to squash-merge
  - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#automergestrategy
  - leave it to "auto" and configure it via github settings instead?
- simplify pr title
  - "Update dependency"
- renovate to not rename a pr title
  - that breaks the email threads from notifications
  - how?
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prtitlestrict
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#commitmessageextra
  - it looks like some logic depends on the suffix "autoclose" to be present
