## must

- ensure automerge waits for all checks to pass
  - see note in https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#platformautomerge
    - also, from "By default, Renovate will not automerge until it sees passing status checks / check runs for the branch" i understand it may merge as soon as _some_ checks pass
  - consider platformAutomerge=false for the time being

## should

- support having comments in the default.json
  - using json5 (ie, default.json5) should work
    - source: https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/
    - vscode support is bad though
      - not supported natively
      - marketplace alternatives don't support other json ide features (eg, schema autocomplete)
- update lock files less regularly
  - eg, once a week
- skip updates less than one week old
  - for security and stability

## could

- Renovate to only create PRs during off-hours (see https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#schedule)
- simplify pr title
  - "Update dependency"

## won't

- renovate to not rename a pr title
  - eg, by suffixing "autoclose" when it closes a pr
  - that breaks the email threads from notifications
  - how?
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prtitlestrict
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#commitmessageextra
  - it looks like some logic depends on the suffix "autoclose" to be present

- https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#github-merge-queue
  - mentioned in https://docs.renovatebot.com/upgrade-best-practices/#make-updating-easy-and-fast as a best practice but i'm not sure it's worth it in single-dev repos
- lock file maintenance prs to include details about the changes
  - eg, what packages were updated, their old and new versions, their changelog
  - probably can't be done as a renovate user
- https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/automerge/#branch-vs-pr-automerging
  - not sure it's a good idea not getting any notification a repo was updated
