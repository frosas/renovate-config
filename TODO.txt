## must

- ensure automerge waits for all checks to pass
  - see note in https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#platformautomerge
    - also, from "By default, Renovate will not automerge until it sees passing status checks / check runs for the branch" i understand it may merge as soon as _some_ checks pass
  - consider platformAutomerge=false for the time being

## should

- support having comments in the default.json
  - using json5 (ie, default.json5) should work
    - source: https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/
    - vscode support is bad though
      - not supported natively
      - marketplace alternatives don't support other json ide features (eg, schema autocomplete)

## could

- Renovate to only create PRs during off-hours (see https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#schedule)
- simplify pr title
  - "Update dependency"

## won't

- renovate to not rename a pr title
  - eg, by suffixing "autoclose" when it closes a pr
  - that breaks the email threads from notifications
  - how?
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#prtitlestrict
    - https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#commitmessageextra
  - it looks like some logic depends on the suffix "autoclose" to be present
